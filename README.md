# CS4501 - Final Year Project: 
## Using Non-Transferable Tokens as Objects on a Decentralised Smart Contract Platform  in a Game Theory Simulation

### Abstract

The objective of this investigative research project is to showcase the feasibility of using Non-Transferable Tokens (NTTs) as Objects within an object-oriented programming framework, specifically for interacting with Smart Contracts on a decentralised platform like Ethereum. This innovative approach holds potential for creating decentralised organisations where tokens could serve as authentication,  identification tools, or any abstract dObject. To validate this concept, a series of simple game-theoretical scenarios will be simulated, in which agents utilising tokens as objects to interact with smart contracts will demonstrate the viability of this approach.
